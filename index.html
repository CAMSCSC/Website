          <h3>What is CAMS CSC</h3>
          <p>CAMS CSC stands for CAMS Computer Science and Cyber Security Club. We are committed to inspiring and
            teaching
            students about computers, hacking, forensics, software, hardware, and most importantly, how to have fun with
            the knowledge and skills that you develop.</p>

          <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
          <p>At CAMS CSC, we believe that learning about computers should not be a mundane task. While this club will
            eventually convert most of the social time currently available to you into social time with your computer,
            the
            knowledge you will gain far supersedes the satisfaction of communicating with humans. We will have frequent
            and rewarding challenges that follow lessons. In addition, we will not force you to show up to every
            meeting.
            However, showing up does benefit you because it will give you an opportunity to interact with other humans
            who
            have similar interests.</p>

          <h1>{ CTF }</h1>

          <h3>Capture the Flag</h3>
          <p>We make learning fun by uncovering the scientific, competitive, legislative, and mischievous nature of
            students. Command your team of up to 3 members as you fervently battle your way into the top of the
            scoreboard
            in the an all year long CTF game. The top teams will get glory, fame, and prizes too! However, this isn't
            the
            usual game of capture the flag where you run around trying to steal other teams' flags. This is the CTF of
            the
            digital world. Teams will be given intimidating challenges to solve. Every challenge contains a special
            string
            of text which is the "flag." Upon discovering a flag, your team can submit it for points. Along the way, you
            will solve cryptographic puzzles, attack flaws on the CTF server, reverse engineer binaries, write simple
            algorithms, and maybe even learn a thing or two.</p>

          <h3>We Educate</h3>
          <p>If learning is much more than regurgitation, then teaching is much more than telling. Teaching is
            explaining,
            demonstrating, and ultimately inspiring. We do not expect anyone to magically understand concepts regarding
            computers simply from experimentation. Sometimes, it is necessary to understand conceptual and abstract
            things
            before one can proceed to apply them in a more advanced way. When we first began as a club, we taught with
            PowerPoint presentations. However, such methods of teaching turned out to be ineffective because everyone
            learned at his/her own pace and PowerPoints lose their value without a presenter. CSC has evolved to use a
            truly integrated online lesson system. We have combined an interactive and mobile capable web interface with
            comprehensive lessons that are easy enough for everyone to understand. Some lessons even have a sprinkle of
            humor. Check it out for yourself!</p>
